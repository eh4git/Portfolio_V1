    "aboutMe": [`My name is Erik Hirsch, I am a full stack developer who incorporates technical ability with collaborative skills to produce innovative web and mobile applications. I truly enjoy collaborating and team environments and I have a passion for learning and problem solving. A few of my technical skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, ES6, Node, MySQL, MongoDB, React, React Native, and Redux. I completed the Web Development Coding Boot Camp at UCLA Extension. The course has given me a solid foundation of technical skills as well as improved my ability to adapt to and learn new ideas and concepts. I am excited to transition into a new career that will challenge me and help me to develop my skills.`,

        `I was born and raised in Southern California and have always admired the concept of developing. Being able to intertwine my creativity and problem-solving abilities with my passion for learning and skill development is what unanimously inspired me to choose web development as a career. This, along with my commitment, resilience, and strong work ethic that was instilled in me at a young age, inevitably became the catalyst for me to earn my certificate in full stack web development from UCLA Extension in July of 2020. Furthermore, I also hold a certificate in business management from Victor Valley College and developed in-depth knowledge on how to fabricate responsive websites and mobile applications, all of which has positioned me to become the respected web developing asset I am today at Third Project Development.`,

        `There is no denying that I love my career, and I take pride in delivering top-quality, fully tailored services that support my client in reaching new levels of digital success. However, in my free time, you can find me enjoying the outdoors, animals, avidly hiking, and being a proud husband and father. In fact, my family is my biggest inspiration and motivation that pushes me to be the best that I can be.
